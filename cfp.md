## What is the purpose of this workshop?

This workshop brings together the people who work on archiving and preserving information from the Web or created with Web technologies. See [the workshop home page](./index.html) for further details.

## How can I attend?

Attendance is free for all invited participants and is open to the public, whether or not W3C members.

If you wish to express interest in attending, please fill out the registration form (<span class="todo">WBS to be done</span>). We want to fill the room with people with practical experience of both Web archival technologies and problems.

Because the venue can accommodate unfortunately only <span class="todo">100</span> attendees, you must receive an acceptance email in order to attend. Also, be sure to keep an eye on [these important dates](#dates).

As an alternative to the registration form, you are encouraged to submit a presentation topic in the form of a [position statement](#position-statements).

Our aim is to get a diversity of attendees from a variety of industries and communities, including:

* Digital archivists, librarians, and records managers who have been pushing the boundaries of web-based technologies
* Community archivists and citizen journalists who have experience with the limits and potential of documenting and preserving on the web
* Creators of archival standards, including such concepts as preservation, discovery, rights management, metadata, etc.
* Creators of web specifications, especially those which might be used by document creators or by those preserving online content, including such things as HTML, metadata schemas, documenting rights management, understanding trusted authorities, etc.
* Other organizations involved in informal and formal preservation of information on the web.


This workshop, as other W3C meetings, operates under its [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).

## How can I suggest a presentation?
{: #position-statements}

This is a Workshop, not a conference, and any presentations will be short, with topics suggested by submissions and decided by the chairs and program committee. Our goal is to actively discuss topics, not to watch presentations.

In order to best facilitate informed discussion, we encourage attendees to read the accepted topics prior to attending the workshop.

If you wish to present on a topic, you should submit a position statement (<span class="todo">WBS to be set up</span>) by the deadline (see [important dates](#dates)). Our program committee will review the input provided, and select the most relevant topics and perspectives.

A good position statement should be a few paragraphs long and should include:

* Your background in the main [topic areas](#topics) of the workshop.
* Which topic you would like to lead discussion on.
* Links to related supporting resources.
* Any other topics you think the workshop should cover in order to be effective.
* A focus on technical issues, not process or platform preference. We plan to talk about the what, not the how.
* Position statements must be in English, preferably in HTML or plain-text format. You may include multiple topics, but we ask that each person submit only a single coherent position statement. The input provided at registration time (e.g., bio, goals, interests) will be published and linked to from this workshop page.
